Getting Started
###############

Requirements
============
 - C++ 17
 - CMake

Tested Compilers / OS
=====================
The CPP SDK is continually tested on the following hardware/compiler combinations:
 - Windows 10: G++ v 12.2.0, CMake v 3.25.0-rc2
 - Windows 10: G++ v 13.2.0, CMake v 3.27.6
 - Windows 11: G++ v 13.2.0, CMake v 3.27.3
 - Windows 10: MSVC v 19.38, CMake v 3.25.0-rc2
 - Windows 11: MSVC v 19.38, CMake v 3.27.3
 - Ubuntu: CLang++ v 10.0.0, CMake v 3.28.0

Run the Getting Started Example
===============================
The best way to validate the download, tool chain, and basic hardware compatibility is by running the GettingStarted example. To do this on command line, example commands are provided for both Windows and Linux operating systems:

.. tab:: Windows


   #. Open /cpp/examples/GettingStarted/ in terminal
   #. Create a new build directory and open it

      ``>> mkdir build``

      ``>> cd build``
   #. Configure and build the project using cmake 

      ``>> cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -S ../ -B ./``

      ``>> cmake --build ./``
   #. Run the compiled file

      Notice you can run this file by passing the COM port as a command line argument or by hard coding the value inside the GettingStarted example file. The VectorNav USB Adapter will show up in Windows as COMXX where XX is the COM port number. 

      ``>> ./GettingStarted.exe COM8``

.. tab:: Linux

   #. Open /cpp/examples/GettingStarted/ in terminal
   #. Create a new build directory and open it

      ``>> mkdir build``

      ``>> cd build/``
   #. Configure and build the project using cmake 

      ``>> cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -S ../ -B ./``

      ``>> cmake --build ./``
   #. Run the compiled file

      Notice you can run this file by passing the COM port as a command line argument or by hard coding the value inside the GettingStarted example file. The VectorNav USB Adapter will show up in Linux as /dev/ttyUSBX where X is a number (usually 0). 

      ``>> ./GettingStarted /dev/ttyUSB0``
