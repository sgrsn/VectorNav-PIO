VectorNav C++ SDK
#################

The VectorNav C++ SDK provides a software interface to communicate with, configure, and parse the outputs of any VectorNav sensor. It contains definitions of the complete protocol of VectorNav register definitions, commands, and measurement outputs, matching the latest ICD. Both synchronous and asynchronous messages are supported, and it is all polling-based.
Written using C++17, it is designed to provide maximal flexibility to allow the use of any OS (or non-os), heavily memory-constrained, flash-constrained, or processing-constrained systems. It uses no dynamic memory allocation, allows configurable memory consumption, does not throw exceptions, and can be configured to disable threading. 

Migration Guide
===============
A :doc:`migration guide <pages/MigrationGuide>` has been provided to highlight the changes between VectorNav's Programming Library and VectorNav's Software Development Kit (SDK).
The fundamental way to interface with the sensor is the same but many features have been updated, and the performance has improved significantly. 

This guide is not a how-to guide but a document of new features and changes between the two software packages. 
Please consult the :doc:`Getting Started example <pages/GettingStarted>` for how to use the SDK.
